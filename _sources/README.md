# Dev II - Development Notebooks

Notebooks on Development Econonomics topics. Content was largely written using [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) to mix text, math, and executable code in python, R, and stata to produce simulations, visualizations, and replications. 

Many pages can be run interactively by clicking the rocket button ![](media/../notebooks/media/launch_button.png) at the top of each relevant page. This will launch the notebook on a jupyter server in the cloud. Alternatively, download the notebook (or clone the entire repository) to on your local machine (some guidance in the [Tools](notebooks/tools.md) section).

These materials support the PhD **Econ 842: Development Seminar II** at The Graduate Center at CUNY.
