These materials support the PhD **Econ 842: Development Seminar II** at The Graduate Center at CUNY. Fall 2021 course syllabus [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mp3PpgudOVyCmTZG9z78oD6UY7dtcvV5/view?usp=sharing).


[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) mix markdown text, math, and executable code (in python, R, and stata) to produce output and visualizations. Many notebooks can be run interactively by clicking the rocket button ![](media/../notebooks/media/launch_button.png) at the top of each relevant page. This will launch the notebook in the cloud on a jupyter kernel server ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org). Alternatively, download the notebook, or clone the entire repository, to your local machine and run it there. Guides to getting started with jupyter in the [Tools](notebooks/tools.md) section.
